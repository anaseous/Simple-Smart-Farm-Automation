Smart farm for automated irrigation using NodeRed, RaspberryPi, Soil Moisture Sensor & Relay Module.

# Simple Smart Farm Automation using NodeRed

This project automates irrigation using Node-RED and a Raspberry Pi. It monitors soil moisture levels and controls a solenoid valve for irrigation.

## Features
- Monitors soil moisture levels.
- Automatically turns the irrigation system ON/OFF.
- Provides a dashboard for real-time monitoring and manual control.

## Hardware Used
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Solenoid Valve
- Relay Module
- Raspberry Pi

## Software Used
- Node-RED
- Node-RED Dashboard

## Usage
1. Connect the hardware as per the circuit diagram.
2. Import the `smart_farm_flow.json` into Node-RED.
3. Deploy the flow and access the dashboard.

## Future Enhancements
- Add weather integration to skip irrigation on rainy days.
